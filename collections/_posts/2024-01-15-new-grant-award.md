We're thrilled to announce that our lab has received a major R01 grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop novel artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery!

This 5-year, $2.5 million grant will support our research on:
- Deep learning models for predicting drug-target interactions
- Graph neural networks for molecular property prediction
- Interpretable AI methods for understanding drug mechanisms

The project brings together expertise from computational biology, machine learning, and medicinal chemistry. We'll be collaborating with Dr. Alice Chen's lab at Partner University to validate our predictions experimentally.

We're looking for talented postdocs and graduate students to join this exciting project! If you're interested, please [contact us](/contact/).

This grant will allow us to expand our research team and computational resources, accelerating our work on developing AI-driven approaches to drug discovery. We're grateful for the NIH's support and look forward to making significant contributions to this important field.
