We're delighted to welcome three new members who are joining our lab this winter!

**Dr. Bob Johnson** joins us as a postdoctoral researcher after completing his PhD at Graduate University. Bob's expertise in protein engineering and structural biology will strengthen our drug design efforts.

**Alice Wong** joins as a Research Data Analyst after graduating from Local University with a B.S. in Data Science. Alice will help manage our computational infrastructure and develop visualization tools.

**Mike Chen** is starting his rotation as a first-year graduate student in the Bioinformatics program. Mike is interested in applying machine learning to genomics data.

Please join us in giving them a warm welcome! We're excited to have them as part of our team and look forward to their contributions to our research.

We'll be having a welcome lunch next Friday at noon in the conference room - all lab members are invited!
