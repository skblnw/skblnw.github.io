We're thrilled to announce that our lab has received a major grant to develop novel artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery!

The project brings together expertise from molecular modeling, machine learning, and genomics. We'll be collaborating with Prof. Jia Meng's lab at XJTLU to consolidate our computational pipeline on end-to-end basis.
